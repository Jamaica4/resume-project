I enjoy reading, writing stories, and sewing. In my free time I enjoy feeding stray cats and dogs
because i love to give to the less fortunate. Some might not know this about me but I speak
two languages and are currently working on my thrid language to expand my vocabulary.
Outside of my life at school, I like to fish, swim, dance, chatting and play video games with my friends
